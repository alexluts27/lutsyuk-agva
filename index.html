  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>My first page in AGVA Web Design.</p> HTML describes the structure of a web page. It is the standard markup language 
  for creating web pages and it is made out of a series of elements. It also
  tells the browser how to show the content. <br> I chose to take this class beacause im interested in this sort of thing and enjoy doing it.
  i also would like to learn how to create my own website. I chose it beacuase 
  i think it will be very helpfull in the future.
